## **Current Portfolio Holdings (as of Oct 9, 2025)**

1. Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
2. Newmont Corp. (NEM)
3. Seagate Technology (STX)
4. GE Vernova (GEV)
5. Western Digital (WDC)
6. General Electric (GE)

10. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)

**Initial allocation:** $1,000 per stock (~100 shares depending on Oct 9 price)

***

## **Calculation Formulas**

### **Portfolio Value:**
- Initial shares purchased = $1,000 / stock price on Oct 9, 2025
- Current stock value = Initial shares × Current stock price
- Total portfolio value = Sum of all 10 stock values

### **Weekly Change %:**
```
((Current Week Value - Previous Week Value) / Previous Week Value) × 100
```

### **Total Return %:**
```
((Current Value - $10,000) / $10,000) × 100
```

### **Benchmark Comparison:**
```
Portfolio Excess Return = Portfolio Total Return - S&P 500 Total Return
```
- If positive: "Outperforming S&P 500 by X%"
- If negative: "Underperforming S&P 500 by X%"

***

## **Rebalancing Triggers**

### **Consider rebalancing when:**
- Any single stock drops >25% from its purchase price
- Any stock becomes >20% of total portfolio value (concentration risk)
- Any sector exceeds 40% of portfolio value
- Portfolio underperforms S&P 500 for 3+ consecutive weeks
- Major earnings miss or analyst downgrade to "Sell"
- Company faces significant regulatory/legal issues
- Stock shows broken technical support or negative momentum shift

### **Rebalancing Process:**
1. Identify underperformer(s) and reason for change
2. Search for replacement with similar risk profile and momentum
3. Provide side-by-side comparison (old vs new stock)
4. Show expected impact on portfolio
5. Wait for user confirmation before executing
6. Document change date, reason, and new allocation

***

## **Weekly Analysis Requirements**

### **Data to Collect:**
1. Current closing prices for all 10 holdings
2. S&P 500 index level (closing value)
3. Bitcoin price (BTC-USD closing)
4. Major market news from the week
5. Earnings reports for any portfolio holdings
6. Fed announcements or economic data releases
7. Sector rotation trends

### **Analysis to Perform:**
- Calculate current portfolio value
- Calculate weekly change % and total return %
- Compare performance vs S&P 500 and Bitcoin
- Assess each stock's momentum and technical position
- Identify risks: market volatility, liquidity, credit, interest rate
- Review sector exposure and diversification
- Determine if any rebalancing triggers are met

### **Recommendation Requirements:**
- Provide concrete action: **HOLD**, **REBALANCE**, **SELL [ticker]**, or **BUY [ticker]**
- If HOLD: Explain why current positions remain optimal
- If REBALANCE: Specify which stock(s) to change and replacement(s)
- Include 2-3 specific market events that influenced the week
- Reference actual performance data (percentages, price movements)
- Consider momentum, YTD performance, and sector rotation

## **Data Handling Protocol**

### **If Stock Price Data is Unavailable:**
1. Use the most recent available closing price
2. Note the data limitation in the weekly recommendation
3. Mark affected calculations with asterisk (*)
4. Try alternative sources: Yahoo Finance → Google Finance → MarketWatch

### **If Market is Closed (Holiday/Weekend):**
1. Use last trading day's closing prices
2. Clearly state: "Markets closed on [date], using [last trading date] data"

### **If a Stock is Halted/Delisted:**
1. Immediately flag for SELL recommendation
2. Search for replacement from same sector with similar momentum
3. Document the event prominently in weekly review
4. Wait for user approval before making change

***

## **Error Handling**

### **If Web Search Returns No Results:**
1. Try alternative search terms (company name instead of ticker)
2. Verify if market is open/closed
3. Try direct navigation to Yahoo Finance or Google Finance
4. If still unavailable, clearly state limitation in blog post

### **If Data Sources Conflict:**
1. Prefer official exchange data > Yahoo Finance > Google Finance > news sites
2. Document which source was used
3. If significant discrepancy, note it in the weekly review

### **If Calculation Seems Wrong:**
1. Double-check math manually
2. Verify all data inputs
3. Compare to previous week for reasonableness check
4. If anomaly persists, flag it in the recommendation section
